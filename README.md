# **AI Stock Trading Project with Real-Time Integration**

## **Overview**
This project leverages machine learning and real-time data integration to build an AI-powered stock trading system. Using historical data and real-time stock prices, the model predicts future price movements and generates actionable buy/sell signals based on dynamic thresholds. The system is optimized for NVIDIA stock (symbol: NVDA) and integrates **Yahoo Finance** for live trading data.

## **Motivation**
The goal of this project is to harness the power of AI to predict stock prices accurately and use actionable trading strategies to maximize returns. This initiative has enabled:
- Learning advanced machine learning techniques.
- Understanding financial data preprocessing and trading strategies.
- Developing real-time trading systems that generate buy/sell signals dynamically.

## **Project Progress**
### **1. Historical Data Analysis**
- Used NVIDIA historical stock data to build and train a Random Forest Regressor.
- Added normalized features (MinMaxScaler) and lagged historical prices for better predictive accuracy.
- Successfully evaluated model performance with metrics:
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** 3.4050e-05
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 0.0026
  - **RÂ² Score:** 0.9983 (highly accurate predictions)

### **2. Trading Signals and Backtesting**
- Incorporated trading logic to define clear buy, sell, and hold signals based on predicted vs actual prices.
- Backtested strategies with an initial balance of $10,000:
  - Final Portfolio Value: **$17,387.87**
  - **Cumulative Return:** 73.88%
- Used Python scripts to simulate trading performance over historical data.

### **3. Real-Time Data Integration**
- Integrated Yahoo Finance API (`yfinance`) to fetch live stock prices.
- Built a real-time trading loop to predict future prices and generate dynamic trading signals every minute.
- Automated "Buy," "Sell," and "Hold" recommendations based on a 0.5% price change threshold.

### **4. Challenges Faced**
- Encountered network restrictions while in China, requiring VPN support for API connectivity.
- Developed workarounds, including switching to Yahoo Finance for seamless data access.

## **Future Directions**
As this project evolves, the next steps include:
1. **Enhancing Trading Logic**:
   - Incorporate advanced indicators like RSI, Bollinger Bands, and MACD for improved decision-making.
   - Experiment with neural networks like LSTMs for time-series predictions.

2. **Expanding Data Scope**:
   - Apply the model to other stocks and sectors for diversification.
   - Explore multi-stock portfolio optimization.

3. **Live Trading Deployment**:
   - Integrate with trading platforms (e.g., Interactive Brokers) for fully automated execution.
   - Deploy a dashboard for interactive monitoring of signals.

4. **Exploration in Australia**:
   - Utilize unrestricted network access to experiment further with real-time integration and automation.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python Libraries**: Pandas, scikit-learn, yfinance, matplotlib
- **Machine Learning Model**: Random Forest Regressor
- **APIs**: Yahoo Finance (for real-time data access)
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code

## **Achievements**
- Designed an end-to-end AI trading system capable of real-time analysis.
- Achieved exceptional returns on backtesting simulations.
- Learned and implemented cutting-edge techniques in financial modeling.

## **Acknowledgment**
This journey exemplifies the fusion of machine learning and financial analysis to create tangible results. While in China, network limitations added unique challenges, which I overcame through adaptability and determination. As I move forward in Australia, I look forward to continuing this exploration and pushing the boundaries of AI in trading.
